/*
 * **** Find longest length bi-valued slice in an array ***
 *
 * You are given a sequence of n integers and the task is to find the maximum slice of the array which contains
 * no more than two different numbers.
 *
 * Example:
 * 1. Input: [1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3]
 * Output: 6
 * Max slice is [2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3] which contains only two numbers 2 and 3 and the length is 6
 *
 * 2. Input: [1, 2, 3]
 * Output: 2
 * Max slice is either [1, 2] or [2, 3] which contains only two numbers and the length is 2
 *
 * 3. Input: [1, 4, 4, 1, 4]
 * Output: 5
 * Max slice is whole array which contains only two numbers 1 and 4 and the length is 5
 * 4. Input: [2]
 * Output: 1
 * Max slice is whole array which contains only one number 2 and the length is 1
